### 🌀 Projects of the Arcane

- [**gitgeist**](https://github.com/Zippytwr/gitgiest) — CLI tool for exploring Git history as a divination practice.

### ☠️ Philosophy

> "I don’t just write code — I summon it.  
> Each function a rune, each commit a whisper through the static."

I love **Go's minimalism** and **frontend flexibility**, but deep down I’m more of a **lone engineer** than a team player.
